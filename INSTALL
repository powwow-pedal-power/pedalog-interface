pedalog-interface
-----------------

This software uses the libpedalog-mono library to communicate with Pedalog devices.

libpedalog-mono in turn relies on the libpedalog C library being available. A binary version
is included for Windows - on Linux, it should be installed system-wide as described below.

How to build on Windows:

1) Build the solution in Debug mode in Visual Studio (Express Edition is fine)
2) Download the free Inno Setup utility (http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php)
3) Open the windows\installer\Pedalog.iss file, and compile it in Inno Setup
4) A setup.exe installer should be created in windows\installer\Output - this will install
   both the Pedalog interface and the USB drivers necessary to use it in Windows. Once
   the drivers have been installed, the software can be run directly from within Visual
   Studio.

How to build on Linux:

1) Add the following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list:

   deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/powwow-pedal-power/pedalog/ubuntu maverick main
   deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/powwow-pedal-power/pedalog/ubuntu maverick main

2) Install the necessary dependencies:

   sudo apt-get install libpedalog0

3) The easiest way to build the software is MonoDevelop::

   sudo apt-get install monodevelop

4) Open the .sln file in MonoDevelop, build and run
